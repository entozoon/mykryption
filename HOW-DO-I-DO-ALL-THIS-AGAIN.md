Okay so from the POV of the parent folder (e.g. Cloud):

There are various [mykrypt] folders which exist only locally.
These are encrypted into Public via mykryption.bat

All that juicy encrypted data can then be pushed to/pulled from amazon drive via mykryption/Commands/ bat files.

So Public should be the same locally and remotely.
In future I could make it pull only certain remote stuff, and handle the push/pull within mykryption.

Passwords aren't written anywhere of course so don't bother looking lol duh, not complicated.
